# BurstSpeed
Data and analysis for my senior thesis project on development/performance tradeoffs in wood frog tadpoles, 2019-2020.

# Project Descript
Amphibians are particularly vulnerable to climate change, and the wood frog, a widely distributed North American anuran, is a good candidate for studying the effects of warming. Because wood frogs breed in temporary ponds, their breeding timelines are constrained by spring ice melt and summer pond drying. As ice melts later and summers get hotter, wood frog tadpoles are being forced to develop more quickly than before in order to avoid death by desiccation when their ponds dry up.

My project examines what effects might result from this more rapid development. Previous research has shown that fast-developing organisms often pay some sort of performance cost. One analogy is to IKEA furniture: you can put it together quickly, but it's not as high-quality as a hand-carved, artisan piece that takes much longer.

Over the summer of 2019, I measured burst swimming speed (how fast the tadpoles can "sprint" away from a predator attack, for example) as a metric of swimming performance in tadpoles from ponds in northwestern Connecticut. These tadpoles were reared in the lab under two different temperature treaments, representing the high and low ends of the temperature regime they would likely encounter in the wild.

I test the hypothesis that if there is a tradeoff between developmental rate and swimming performance, then slower-developing tadpoles (cold temperature treatment) will show faster burst swimming speeds than their fast-developing counterparts.
